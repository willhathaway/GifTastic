# GifTastic

This project is based around an AJAX request to the Giphy API. The challenge was to construct a query URL to include in the AJAX request. It being October, I themed the options accordingly. There's an additional feature to add a monster to the list. Navigating through the response object from the Giphy API was difficult, but it was a good challenge to demonstrate how using data from other sites works.
